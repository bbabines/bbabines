Instruction for viewing live projects on Github.
1. make sure that the main HTML file of your project is called index.html. If it is not, you will need to rename it.
2. go to your GitHub repo on the web.
3. click on the Settings button from the panel at the top.
4. click on Pages on the left side bar.
5. change the Source from none to main branch and click Save.
6. it may take a few minutes (the GitHub website says up to 10, but we’ve seen it take up to an hour. Do not add a “theme” to your project, or you may have git conflicts, instead, be patient.) but your project should be accessible over the web from your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name (obviously substituting your own details in the link).
